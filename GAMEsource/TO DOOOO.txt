create a properly sized map array when you receive the logicdata
define max sizes of the map (control where? gamemanager or logicmanager?)
Remove "magic numbers" from the string reading part of gamelevel (45 means '-' etc)
Create enum for the types used in gamelevel and use it in the switch cases
Extract the string cutting functionality into a general function to be used along the program and fix the "final comma" issue
Check that we are not duplicating IDs (from GameManager side?)
